"""Local MPS provider for the shared behavioral substrate.

Implements the same `complete(messages) -> {"text": ...}` contract as
`mock_provider.ScriptedProvider`, so `family_screen`, `binding_runner` and the
branch runners do not know whether they are talking to a real model.

Greedy decoding, deliberately. A revealed-preference experiment must record the
model's choice, not the sampler's; and the competence screen must be repeatable.
