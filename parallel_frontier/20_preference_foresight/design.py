"""Exact randomized design for preference foresight.

Each admitted pair has a canonically preferred family `P` and the other `O`. The
model is randomly assigned to actually perform one of them three times, then
makes a binding choice between them.

    realized_change = P(choose P | performed P) - P(choose P | performed O)

Negative is satiation: doing the thing makes you less likely to choose it again.
Positive is momentum. Zero means recent experience does not move the preference.

The arm is crossed with the full Q/K counterbalance, because the whole point of
`choice_prompts` is that an apparent preference shift must not be a label or
order effect that happened to land unevenly across arms.
