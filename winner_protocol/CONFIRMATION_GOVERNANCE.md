# DEV → Freeze → Confirmation Governance

## Development

You may inspect DEV outputs while selecting:
- model;
- layer;
- steering factor.

DEV carrier prompts are not confirmation evidence.

## Freeze

Once a cell passes the joint DEV gates:

```bash
python freeze_protocol.py \
  --model <MODEL> \
  --vector-file <VECTOR_PATH> \
  --layer <LAYER> \
  --factor <FACTOR> \
  --selected-dev-summary <DEV_SUMMARY_JSON> \
  --out protocol_confirm.json
```

This resolves and stores immutable Hugging Face model/vector revisions, the exact
12 confirmation carriers, persona text, success rules, and SHA-256 hashes of all
code used by confirmation.

Commit `protocol_confirm.json` **before** running confirmation.

## Confirmation

```bash
python run_confirm.py \
  --protocol protocol_confirm.json \
  --out results/confirm_raw.jsonl

python analyze_confirm.py \
  --protocol protocol_confirm.json \
  --raw results/confirm_raw.jsonl \
  --out results/confirm_summary.json
```

The runner refuses overwrite and refuses source/prompt drift.

## After confirmation starts

Do not change:
- model/vector;
- layer/factor;
- carrier list;
- persona prompts;
- readout wording;
- arms;
- target-query primary contrast;
- success threshold.

Bugs that invalidate the execution can justify a repaired prospective
confirmation, but:
1. retain the failed/inspected artifact;
2. document the defect;
3. freeze the repair before rerun;
4. use fresh confirmation carriers if the original outcomes were exposed enough
   to guide substantive design choices.

That is the standard used when a codebook study's inspected precursor required
repair.


## Modal confirmation

After `protocol_confirm.json` is committed:

```bash
modal run modal_confirm.py --protocol protocol_confirm.json
```

The Modal wrapper accepts **no model/layer/factor overrides**. Those come only
from the frozen protocol. It writes the raw rows, manifest, summary, and run log
back locally.

The scientific runner records Python, PyTorch, Transformers, and
huggingface_hub versions in the manifest.
